# Truchet Tile Experiments

A collection of p5.js sketches exploring square and hex-based Truchet-style tile systems. It started as a way to generate sleep-screen artwork for an XTeink X4 e-ink display and has diverged into some experiments with my own tilesets.

## Sketches

- `p5-truchet-diagonal.js`: classic diagonal split square tiles (random 4-way rotation)
- `p5-truchet-diagonal-480x800.js`: diagonal split variant sized for 480x800
- `p5-truchet-arcs-480x800.js`: classic two-arc Truchet tiles
- `p5-10print-polygon-480x800.js`: "10 PRINT"-style thick slash polygons
- `p5-smith-tiles-480x800.js`: constrained checkerboard group placement
- `truchet_classic_p5.js`: additional classic p5 sketch

## Hex tile-set

- `p5-hex-tile-set.js`: labeled hex tile-set definitions
- `p5-hex-random-first-attempt.js`: first random hex tiling attempt
- `p5-hex-random-second-attempt.js`: second constrained hex tiling attempt
- `truchet_hex_rule_based_second_attempt.js`: rule-based hex placement attempt

## Running a single sketch in the p5 web editor

1. Open `https://editor.p5js.org/`
2. Paste one sketch file into the editor
3. Run

## Export

Most sketches support:

- `R` to regenerate
- `S` to save a PNG
